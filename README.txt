Files developed by Cole Weinstein (and Robbie Young) during Carleton College's CS311 - Computer Graphics, taught by Josh Davis.

Almost all of the information pertinent to the course and the files tracked on this Github can be found at http://www.joshuadavis.us/teaching/2022f311/index.html, Josh's course website. Most important is the "Help Yourself" section, which provides links to subpages describing the assignments of each project in great detail. Also in this section is a link to an installation tutorial for GLFW and Vulkan, the two main graphics tools used throughout the course. Many thanks to Mike Tie, Technical Director at Carleton College, for so generously writing the installation tutorial and providing invaluable troubleshooting assistance.

proj1/ includes files for a rudimentary graphics engine made using OpenGL and its GLFW library.

xx0main____.c files can be compiled using the command listed in the comments at the top of the file and run to present a small demo of the current abilities of the engine on a given day.
